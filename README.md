Titanic Survival Prediction
A machine learning project focused on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the renowned Titanic dataset.

## üõ† Project Overview
This project involves developing a predictive model that estimates whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on key features such as:

Passenger Class (Pclass)

Gender (Sex)

Age

Fare

Embarked Port

Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard (SibSp)

Number of Parents/Children aboard (Parch)

The project covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and applying machine learning models to make accurate predictions.


## üìä Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

Data Loading: Load the Titanic dataset using pandas.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values

Encode categorical variables

Perform feature engineering (create new useful features)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize data to identify patterns and relationships

Model Building:

Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

Evaluate model performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and more

Prediction and Conclusion:

Predict survival on new or unseen data
